	There are numerous commercial cognitive training (also called brain training) programs claiming to improve mental abilities. However, scientific evidence for such claims is often inconsistent. One particularly promising cognitive training approach is to target working memory, which is the ability to maintain and process information in the present moment. There is some evidence on the effectiveness of certain cognitive training interventions, working memory training shows transfer to fluid intelligence (i.e., the ability to reason abstractly and solve novel problems), which is frequently the target of cognitive training because it is highly predictive of educational and professional success.
	<br><br>Various visual working memory models, such as Standard Mixture Model (Zhang & Luck, 2008), Hierarchical Interference Measurement Model (Oberauer et al., 2017) and Conjunctive Population Code Model ( Schneegans & Bays, 2017), have been introduced to provide theoretical explanations and measure visual working memory performance more precisely.
	<br><br> Given the crucial role of working memory in fluid intelligence and academic or professional success, <b>the current study</b> aims to investigate whether visual working memory training can improve working memory capacity and quality by comparing working memory performance before and after working memory training relative to visual search training. We will also investigate how such improvements can be explained by these three prominent models. The findings from the current study will advance both working memory theory by comparing these models and their application in evaluating the effectiveness of training.
