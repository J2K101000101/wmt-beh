<h1>Participant Information Sheet</h1>

<p> You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before deciding whether to participate in this study, it is important to understand what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information and ask the experimenter if anything is unclear or if you would like more information. Please remember that <b><u> you are free to withdraw at any time during the study and without giving a reason.</u></b>
	
	<br><br>Shuangke Jiang is running this research study as part of her PhD research project at the University of Sheffield. Dr. Claudia von Bastian and Dr. Myles Jones are supervising the study. This project has been approved by the University of Sheffield’s Ethics Review Committee administered by the Psychology Department.
	 
	<br><br><b>What is the purpose and format of the study?  </b> We wish to investigate whether cognitive training can improve cognitive performance more broadly, and how this can be explained by current theoretical models. 

	<br><br>If you decide to take part, we will first need to ask you a few questions to make sure that it is okay for you to be involved in this study. If you are eligible to participate, you can sign up through Prolific. You will first be asked to complete a pre-test, which should take approximately 40 minutes. Then, you will complete four 30-min training sessions of a cognitive task. Lastly, you will be asked to complete a post-test and thanked for your participation. 

	<br><br>We will record some personal details such as age, gender and handedness. You will be assigned a participant ID number to ensure that your personal information is not used in any part of the research.

	<br><br><b> Inclusion criteria: 
	</b><br>Age between 18 and 35 years old.
	<br>Proficient English for understanding the task instructions.
	<br>Educated to A-level or higher.
	<br>No current diagnosis of neurological, psychological or psychiatric illness. 
	<br>Normal or corrected-to-normal vision. 
	<br>No current medication with known side effects on cognition, in particular memory and attention. 
	<br>No current recreational drug use (e.g., cannabis, cocaine, or methamphetamines). 

	<br><br><b> What is cognitive training?
	</b> Cognitive training is the repetitive practice of cognitive tasks designed to improve cognitive skills. We are testing how effective cognitive training is in terms of yielding broad cognitive benefits.

	
	<br><br><b> How long will the study last? 
	</b>Each session will last approximately 30-40 minutes. You will be required to participate in a total of six sessions (maximum one session daily). 



	<br><br><b> How will your time be compensated?
	</b>To compensate for your time, you will recieve a total of £17.4 for completing the study (£3.5/session for the pre-test and post-test sessions, and £2.6/session for four training sessions) through Prolific.


	<br><br><b> What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?
	</b>There are no specific disadvantages or risks of taking part in this study.



	<br><br><b> What if something goes wrong?
	</b>If you are harmed by your participation in this study, there are no special compensation arrangements, but you will be covered by the University’s standard indemnity policy. If you have any cause to complain, please in the first instance contact the primary researcher Ms Shuangke Jiang (sjiang17@sheffield.ac.uk) or one of the project supervisors, Dr. Claudia von Bastian (c.c.vonbastian@sheffield.ac.uk) or Dr. Myles Jones (m.jones@sheffield.ac.uk). If following this you feel that your complaint has not been handled to your satisfaction, you can contact the Head of the Psychology Department (Professor Glenn Waller; g.waller@sheffield.ac.uk) who will then escalate the complaint through the appropriate channels. If the complaint relates to the handling of personal data, information on how to initiate this complaint can be found in the University’s Privacy Notice: https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/govern/data-protection/privacy/general. 

	<br><br><b> What if I change my mind during the study?
	</b>If you decide to take part, you are still free to withdraw at any time during the study and without giving a reason. There will be no negative consequences if you choose to withdraw. However, as all data will be anonymised after the posttest, it is only possible to withdraw yourself and your data during the study and not after you have completed the posttest session. 

	<br><br><b> What will happen to the information from the study?
	</b> All personal information collected will be kept strictly confidential and not shared with anyone outside of the research team. We intend to publish the results of the study in scientific journals.  Anonymised data from the experimental tasks may later be made available to other researchers via datasets in accordance with the Open Science Framework or in journal publications. No individuals who take part in the study will be identified at any stage.


	<br><br><b> Legal basis for processing your personal data
	</b>According to data protection legislation, we are required to inform you that the legal basis we are applying in order to process your personal data is that ‘processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest’ (Article 6(1)(e)). Further information can be found in the University’s Privacy Notice https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/govern/data-protection/privacy/general. 


	<br><br>You can only withdraw your data during the study because after you complete the study your data will be anonymised.
	The University of Sheffield will act as the Data Controller for this study. This means that the University is responsible for looking after your information and using it properly. The Department of Psychology of the University of Sheffield is organising and funding this research.
